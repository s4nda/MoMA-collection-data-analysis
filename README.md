# MoMA Collection Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing the artists and artworks represented in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA).

## Analysis

- Artists' age: We explore the distribution of artists' ages at the time of their death. The data shows that the majority of artists lived up to their seventies, and interestingly, female artists tended to live slightly longer than male artists by 3.03 years on average. Additionally, we identified artists who lived for more than a century.

- Artists' gender: We analyze the gender breakdown of artists in MoMA's collection. The fact that the great majority of artists(81.8%) and artworks(86.1%) in MoMA's collection are male/done by male artists, suggests a gender imbalance in the art world. We also look at how gender is distributed across different nationalities and art departments and find that male artists are more dominant across all. However, it's worth noting that one of the top-ranked artists in the collection is a female, ranking second on the list.

- Artists' nationality: We identify the top 5 nationalities represented in MoMA's collection. Among the top 5 the majority are American artists(62,4%). The presence of German (11,2%), French (10,1%), British (10%), and Italian (6.4%) artists highlights the significance of these countries in the development of modern art. Interestingly, the top ten artists with the artworks in the collection represent a diverse range of nationalities with half of them being French.

- Artworks/ nationality: while the majority of artists in MoMA's collection are American (62%), the majority of artworks in the collection are actually created by artists of other nationalities, with American artists contributing 44.6% of the artworks and artists of other nationalities contributing 55.4%. This suggests that MoMA's collection is truly global and represents a diverse range of artistic styles and traditions from around the world.


- Top mediums: We identify the mediums that are most commonly used in MoMA's collection.
