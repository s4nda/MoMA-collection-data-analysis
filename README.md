## Analysis

### Artists & Age: 
- We explore the distribution of artists' ages at the time of their death. The data shows that the majority of artists lived up to their seventies, and interestingly, female artists tended to live slightly longer than male artists by 3.03 years on average. Additionally, we identified artists who lived for more than a century.

### Artists & Gender: 
- We analyze the gender breakdown of artists in MoMA's collection. The great majority of artists(81.8%) and artworks(86.1%) in MoMA's collection are male/done by male artists. We also look at how gender is distributed across different nationalities and art departments and find that male artists are more dominant across all. However, it's worth noting that one of the top-ranked artists in the collection is a female, ranking second on the list.

### Artists & Nationality: 
- We identify the top 5 nationalities represented in MoMA's collection. The majority are American artists(62,4%), but the presence of German, French, British, and Italian artists highlights the importance of these countries in the development of modern art. It is also worth noting that the top 10 artists with the highest number of artworks in MoMA's collection represent a diverse range of nationalities, with half of them being French.

### Artworks:

- We identified the three primary methods by which the museum acquires artworks for its collection. Aside from purchasing artworks, the museum also acquires artworks through donations from big collectors and gifts from artists themselves.

- Out of the 130,262 artworks in MoMA's collection, the most frequently represented medium classifications are print, photograph, illustrated book, drawing, and design. Painting, on the other hand, appears to be a relatively smaller portion of the collection.

- Considering that prints are the most common medium in the collection, we posed a fun question of how big a wall would need to be to display all the prints if it were 2 meters high. Calculations reveal that the wall would need to be approximately 2.8 kilometers long.

### Artworks & Nationality: 
- While the majority of artists in MoMA's collection are American, the majority of artworks in the collection are actually created by artists of other nationalities, with American artists contributing 44.6% of the artworks and artists of other nationalities contributing 55.4%.
