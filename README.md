# MoMA Collection Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing the artists and artworks represented in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA).

## Analysis

- Artists' age: We explore the distribution of artists' ages at the time of their death. The data shows that the majority of artists lived up to their seventies, and interestingly, female artists tended to live slightly longer than male artists by 3.03 years on average. Additionally, we identified artists who lived for more than a century.

- Artists' gender: We analyze the gender breakdown of artists in MoMA's collection. The fact that 81.8% of artists in MoMA's collection are male, suggests a gender imbalance in the art world. We also look at how gender is distributed across different nationalities and art departments and find that male artists are more dominant across all. However, it's worth noting that one of the top-ranked artists in the collection is a female, ranking second on the list.

- Artists' nationality: We identify the top 5 nationalities represented in MoMA's collection.The majority of artworks, 62%, are by American artists, reflecting the museum's emphasis on American modern and contemporary art. Additionally, the presence of German, French, British, and Italian artists highlights the significance of these countries in the development of modern art. Interestingly, the top ten artists with the most artworks in the collection represent a diverse range of nationalities, indicating the global influence of modern art and its impact on artists from various regions.

- Top mediums: We identify the mediums that are most commonly used in MoMA's collection.
