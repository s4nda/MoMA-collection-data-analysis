## Analysis

### Artists' age: 
- We explore the distribution of artists' ages at the time of their death. The data shows that the majority of artists lived up to their seventies, and interestingly, female artists tended to live slightly longer than male artists by 3.03 years on average. Additionally, we identified artists who lived for more than a century.

### Artists' gender: 
- We analyze the gender breakdown of artists in MoMA's collection. The great majority of artists(81.8%) and artworks(86.1%) in MoMA's collection are male/done by male artists. We also look at how gender is distributed across different nationalities and art departments and find that male artists are more dominant across all. However, it's worth noting that one of the top-ranked artists in the collection is a female, ranking second on the list.

### Artists' nationality: 
- We identify the top 5 nationalities represented in MoMA's collection. The majority are American artists(62,4%), but the presence of German, French, British, and Italian artists highlights the significance of these countries in the development of modern art. It is also worth noting that the top 10 artists with the highest number of artworks in MoMA's collection represent a diverse range of nationalities, with half of them being French.

### Artworks/ nationality: 
- While the majority of artists in MoMA's collection are American, the majority of artworks in the collection are actually created by artists of other nationalities, with American artists contributing 44.6% of the artworks and artists of other nationalities contributing 55.4%. 

## Conclusion

The analysis shows that modern art is truly a global phenomenon that has influenced artists from different parts of the world. However, there is still a gender imbalance in the art world, with male artists dominating the collection. It's also interesting to note that while the majority of artists in the collection are American, the artworks themselves are more evenly distributed among artists of different nationalities, highlighting the museum's commitment to collecting art from around the world. Overall, the analysis provides a fascinating glimpse into the diversity and richness of modern art and its global impact but also highlights the gender imbalance in the art world, which has historical roots. It is important to acknowledge and address this issue, art should be inclusive and institutions should provide equal opportunities for all artists, regardless of their gender.
